		<h2 class="mt-4 mb-4">Inspiration and credit</h2>
		This product was inspired by
		<a href="https://world.hey.com/rjs/. ">Ryan Singer</a>'s (kudos!) material on digital product
		development. You can consult his texts here:
		<a href="https://world.hey.com/rjs/">https://world.hey.com/rjs/</a>.
		<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4">Potential for the future</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>allow share a url for current project with other people</li>
			<li>
				allow users to create a personal account and save data in the cloud to manage several
				projects
			</li>
			<li>embed excalidraw to allow draw flows and shapes</li>
			<li>allow integration with zapier or make</li>
			<li>manage releases of scopes inspired by something like Story Map</li>
			<li>etc</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4">Data & Analytics</h2>
		<p>Currently, all data is being stored in your own browser, using localStorage.</p>
		<!-- <p>
			I installed Mixpanel only to know about pages visited and actions executed, without any
			personal information. I don't track any other data.

			> anything.
		</p> -->
		<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4">Context and learning</h2>
		<p>To develop this product I'm using Svelte + SvelteKit.</p>
		<p>
			I made this first version while relearning how to develop software and at the same time
			learning Svelte and SvelteKit, after many years without developing.
		</p>
		<p>There were mixed days of excitement, frustration, study, and trial and error.</p>
		<p>In recent years I worked as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Product Manager</li>
			<li>HR Manager</li>
			<li>Teacher on leadership</li>
			<li>
				Consultant helping organization in organizational design, culture and product management.
			</li>
		</ul>
