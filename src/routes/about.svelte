		<h2 class="mt-4 mb-4">Inspiration and credit</h2>
		This product was inspired by
		<a href="https://world.hey.com/rjs/. ">Ryan Singer</a>'s (kudos!) material on digital product
		development. You can consult his texts here:
		<a href="https://world.hey.com/rjs/">https://world.hey.com/rjs/</a>.
		<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4">Potential for the future</h2>

		<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4">Data</h2>
		Currently, all data is being stored in your own browser, using localStorage.
		<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4">Context and learning</h2>
		<p>To develop this product I'm using Svelte + SvelteKit.</p>
		<p>
			I made this first version while relearning how to develop software and at the same time
			learning Svelte and SvelteKit, after many years without developing.
		</p>
		<p>There were mixed days of excitement, frustration, study, and trial and error.</p>
		<p>In recent years I worked as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Product Manager</li>
			<li>HR Manager</li>
			<li>Teacher on leadership</li>
			<li>
				Consultant helping organization in organizational design, culture and product management.
			</li>
		</ul>
