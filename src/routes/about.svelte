	<h2>Inspiration and credit</h2>
	This product was inspired by
	<a href="https://world.hey.com/rjs/. ">Ryan Singer</a>'s (kudos!) material on digital product
	development. You can consult his texts:

	This is an under development and incomplete version. The data is not yet persisted and is therefore
	lost at the end of the navigation.
	<h2>Technology</h2>
	For this product I am using the Svelte + SvelteKit framework. I made this pilot product while relearning
	how to develop software and while learning Svelte, after more than 1 decade working in other areas.
